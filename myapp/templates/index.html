        I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end. 
        I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. 
        We had a beautiful hotel room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasn’t even expensive. 
        We had a balcony with a wonderful view.

        We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. 
        I was always interested in art, so that was a special treat for me. 
        The museum is so huge, you could spend weeks there. 
        Henry got tired walking around the museum and said, “Enough! I need to take a break and rest.”
